## FX-Data Visualization

This is sample project to visualize forex data using `Shiny` framework. Shiny is powerful tool and can be used to build many interactive visualization and applications. 


In the dashboard, we are showing what is the `ASK` and `BID` prices and sizes for selected banks. We are also showing the change in the spread over the time for the selected banks. You can also see the raw data which we have used to create such plots by clicking on `Data` tab.
